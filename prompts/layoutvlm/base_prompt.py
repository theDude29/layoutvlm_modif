program_prompt = """
Your task is to write a layout program that specifies how to arrange a set of 3D assets in the scene conditioned on the floor plan (i.e., boundary specification). 
Here are the base class definitions:
```python
{base_class_definitions}
```
The list of constraints available are: 
* z-axis constraints: on_top_of.
* position-based constraints: against_wall, distance_constraint.
* orientation-based constraints: align_with, point_towards.
Specify at least one position-based constraint and one orientation-based constraint for each asset to be placed.
Objects by default are placed on the floor. For small objects, please remember to specify on_top_of constraints to ensure they are placed on top of a surface.

You will be given a scene with or without existing assets, and a list of assets to be added to the scene. Your program must contain these parts:
(1) Based on the rendered image of the scene and the layout criteria, calculate and specify the position and rotation for the new asset placements.
(2) Speicfy constraints: based on the layout criteria, specify the constraints for the asset placements. These constraints will be used to ensure that the layout semantics are maintained when the layout is being adjusted to be physically feasible.

Note:
* The x-y plane is the floor, the z-axis is the vertical direction, and the origin is at the center of the room. Thus, if a sofa is on the floor, the z-coordinate should be half the z-axis bounding box size of the sofa.
* A zero degree rotation implies that the object faces +x axis. ([0, 0, 90] means that the object faces +y axis (counterclockwise rotation of 90 degrees).

Here are the dos and don'ts:
* It is very important to decide on the asset placements for all the assets to be placed. Do not forget to decide on the placemnents of any asset to be placed (not the existing assets).
* DO NOT HALLUCINATE ASSETS. Only use the assets provided in the scene description.
* The provided floor plan image is marked with a coordinate system. You can use the coordinate system to specify the placement of the assets in the scene.
* Enclose your answer in ```python ... ``` tags. You don't have to output the given program again.
* Write comments to explain the reasoning behind your code. PLEASE DO NOT REPEAT THE GIVEN PROGRAM and do not re-initialize any existing assets or walls.
* Make sure to specify the constraints for all new asset instances to be placed (i.e. each asset instance in the placements list of the Assets class). 
* Do not overwrite the varaibles of the assets in the scene as we will be using those variable names to extract the final layout (e.g., if there is a variable name chair, do not write `for chair in sofa.placements: ...`)
Only the placement of the the first argument (i.e. asset1) will be updated. The ordering of the arguments effectively decide the direction of the constraint.
If you want to update both assets' placements in the constraint `align_with` for example, you need to specify the constraint twice with the arguments swapped.
For example, if you specify `solver.point_towards(chair[0], sofa[0])`, the chair will point towards the sofa. If you specify `solver.point_towards(sofa[0], chair[0])`, the sofa will be adjusted to point towards the chair.
* Please give a comprehensive list of constraints that will ensure the assets are placed correctly in the scene.
* If you want to specify a constraint bewteen an asset and an absolute coordinate (e.g., the center of the room), you can instantiate a "fixed point" asset by doing AssetInstance(position=[x, y, z]) and use that as the second argument in the constraint function.
* When there are conflicting constraints between two assets, the first constraint you specify will be used. Thus, specify important constraints first.
For example, if you want to specify that a chair should be placed at the center of the room, you can do `solver.distance_constraint(chair[0], AssetInstance(position[center_x, center_y, center_z]), 0, 0, weight=10)`.

MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS SPECIFY "on_top_of" constraints for objects that should not be placed on the floor.
