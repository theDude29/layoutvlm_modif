    "task_description": "a minimalist bedroom with a low-profile queen bed and a vintage oak dresser, 4m x 4m",
    "layout_criteria": "Position the low-profile queen bed against the center of one wall, leaving ample space on both sides for easy access. The bed should have a simple, clean-lined frame in a neutral color like white or light gray. Place the vintage oak dresser on the opposite wall, centered and with enough clearance for drawers to open fully. The dresser should feature a warm, natural wood tone to contrast with the bed's minimalist design. Arrange these two key pieces to create a balanced, open layout that maximizes floor space and maintains a clear path of movement throughout the room. Keep additional furnishings to a minimum to preserve the minimalist aesthetic and spacious feel.",
